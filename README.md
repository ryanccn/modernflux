# Modernflux

A modern look and feel for [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/). Color scheme based on [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/).

## Installation

Copy the CSS for [Mocha](https://modernflux.ryanccn.dev/modernflux.mocha.css), [Macchiato](https://modernflux.ryanccn.dev/modernflux.macchiato.css), [Frappe](https://modernflux.ryanccn.dev/modernflux.frappe.css), or [Latte](https://modernflux.ryanccn.dev/modernflux.latte.css) and paste them in the **Custom CSS** field in settings.

Miniflux's Content Security Policy currently doesn't allow for using `@import`s, which would certainly be more convenient :&lt;
