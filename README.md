# Modernflux

A modern look and feel for [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/). Color scheme based on [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/).

## Installation

There are four flavors (latte, frapp√©, macchiato, and mocha) and fourteen accents (rosewater, flamingo, pink, mauve, red, maroon, peach, yellow, green, teal, sky, sapphire, blue, lavender). Copy the contents of `https://modernflux.ryanccn.dev/modernflux.{flavor}.{accent}.css` and paste it in the **Custom CSS** settings field.

Miniflux's Content Security Policy currently doesn't allow for using `@import`s, which would certainly be more convenient :&lt;
